# Part A
## 1. Objective 
- Use of hot-wire anemometry for velocity measurement
- Analysis of hot-wire data to obtain mean and fluctuating part of the velocities
- Wake charecterstic behind a circular cylinder
## 2. Procedure
1. Study the experimental set-up including each and every component with speciﬁcation.
2. Study the circuit diagram for a constant temperature hot wire circuit.
3. Mount the hot-wire probe in the traversing mechanism and make the necessary signal connection.
4. Make a block diagram of the experimental set up.
5. Calibrate hot wire probe in the free stream without any model in the tunnel.
6. Use a rough cylinder model to generate turbulent wake
7. At one free stream wind speed at a stream-wise station, x, measure velocity proﬁles, both mean and ﬂuctuating component, in the turbulent wake. The origin of x coordinate is at the center of the cylinder and it is increasing in the stream-wise direction.
8. Plot velocity proﬁles, both mean and rms, in normalized forms.
